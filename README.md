# Startwars Species Catalog
-------------------------------------------------

- Pulled Star Wars species data from the Star Wars API using Alamofire
- Used custom response serializers to process the JSON into an array of Swift objects
- Parsed some string fields in the web service JSON with SwiftyJSON
- Displayed the results in a tableview
- Loaded more results as the user scrolled down in the tableview
- Parsing JSON including arrays, strings to arrays and strings to dates (with NSDateFormatter)
- Passing data from a tableview to a detail view, using a storyboard & segue. Tapping on a row in the tableview will open a detail view displaying additional data about that Star Wars species
- Images of each species in the table view
- Deselection animation for tableview
- Programmatically UITableView scrolling
